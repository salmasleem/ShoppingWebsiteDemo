# ShoppingWebsiteDemo

## Introduction 
The objective of this project is to get an experience in developing a network application based on the client/server architecture. We were required to build a web application that is used as a simple shopping website. The website allows the users to lookup products descriptions, types, manufacturers… etc. Users are allowed to create an account, add items to their “cart” and search for products.

## Technologies
1. Node.js: Node.js is an open source platform for executing JavaScript language outside the browser. 
2. Express: Express is a node package that is used as a web application framework.
3. Visual Studio Code (VSCode): VSCode is the IDE that will be used for developing the web application. 
4.  MongoDB: MongoDB is a NoSQL database program. MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. 
5.  Embedded JavaScript (EJS): EJS is a template engine that allows the user to generate HTML with plain JavaScript.
